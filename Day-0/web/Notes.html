      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Over the past 15-20 years, companies have faced challenges in managing their servers, which included the purchase
        of hardware, setup, maintenance, and associated costs. Servers were typically obtained from companies like IBM
        and required additional materials such as cooling fans, air conditioners, network cables, and power supplies.
        These servers were expensive, often come with high configurations, and could support only one application per
        server, resulting in underutilization and increased maintenance costs. To address these issues, virtualization
        emerged as a solution, allowing multiple applications to run on a single server. However, virtualization still
        had limitations, such as inefficient allocation of storage resources. This is where cloud technology revolutionized
        the industry, offering pay-as-you-go services tailored to the specific needs of companies, eliminating the need
        for purchasing physical servers, and reducing maintenance overheads.</p>

      <h2>Benefits of Virtualization</h2>
      <p>Virtualization emerged as a game-changer, enabling companies to host multiple applications on a single server.
        This led to significant cost reductions and simplified maintenance. By consolidating multiple applications onto
        fewer servers, companies could optimize resource utilization and achieve better efficiency. However, challenges
        remained in terms of storage allocation, as resources were often overprovisioned, resulting in wasted capacity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Intro to Cloud</h2>
      <p>Cloud computing emerged as a solution to address the shortcomings of virtualization and further enhance cost
        efficiency. Rather than purchasing physical servers and associated materials, companies could now leverage cloud
        providers who offered scalable resources on demand. Instead of investing in excess storage capacity, businesses
        could pay for the exact amount they required. For instance, if a company needed 30GB of storage for each of its
        four applications, they would only pay for 120GB of storage, eliminating unnecessary expenditures.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Advantages of using Cloud</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Cloud services offer scalability, allowing businesses to easily scale their
          resources up or down based on their requirements. This flexibility eliminated the need for overprovisioning and
          ensured optimal resource utilization.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> By adopting a pay-as-you-go model, companies could significantly reduce the
          upfront costs associated with purchasing hardware. Additionally, maintenance expenses, including power
          consumption, cooling, and hardware upgrades, were shifted to the cloud provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability and Redundancy:</strong> Cloud providers offered robust infrastructure with built-in
          redundancy and high availability. This reduced the risk of downtime and ensured business continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Cloud services enable remote access to applications and data, providing
          flexibility for employees to work from anywhere, and improving productivity and collaboration.</li>
      </ul>
